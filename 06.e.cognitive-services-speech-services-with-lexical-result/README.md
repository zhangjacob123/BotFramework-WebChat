# Sample - Integrating with Cognitive Services Speech Services and using lexical result

> Cognitive Services Speech Services support is currently in preview. If you encounter any problems, please file us an issue at https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/issues/.

A simple page with Web Chat integrated with speech-to-text and text-to-speech feature from Cognitive Services Speech Services, with lexical result. This sample makes changes that are based off of the [Cognitive Services Speech Services sample](./../06.c.cognitive-services-speech-services-js).

# Test out the hosted sample

- [Try out MockBot](https://microsoft.github.io/BotFramework-WebChat/06.e.cognitive-services-speech-services-with-lexical-result)

# How to run locally

- Fork this repository
- Navigate to `/Your-Local-WebChat/samples/06.e.cognitive-services-speech-services-with-lexical-result` in command line
- Run `npx serve`
- Browse to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)

# Things to try out
   - Click on microphone button
   - Say 123
   - It should recognize as "one two three", instead of "123."

### Goals of this bot

We'll start by using the [Cognitive Services Speech Services sample](./../06.c.cognitive-services-speech-services-js) as our template.

The main change you will need to make, regardless of whether you are using the subscription key or authorization token, is adding the value `'lexical'` to a `textNormalization` key in your `webSpeechPonyFillFactory` object.

Subscription key:
```diff
webSpeechPonyfillFactory = await window.WebChat.createCognitiveServicesSpeechServicesPonyfillFactory({
  region: searchParams.get('r') || 'westus',
  subscriptionKey,
+ textNormalization: 'lexical'
});
```

Authorization Token:
```diff
   const res = await fetch('https://webchat-mockbot.azurewebsites.net/speechservices/token', { method: 'POST' });
   const { region, token: authorizationToken } = await res.json();

   webSpeechPonyfillFactory = await window.WebChat.createCognitiveServicesSpeechServicesPonyfillFactory({
     authorizationToken,
     region,
+    textNormalization: 'lexical'
   });
```
