# Sample - Forward All Incoming Activities to a JavaScript Event

This sample shows how to set up a Web Chat client that will forward all incoming activity to a JavaScript event named `webchatincomingactivity`.

# Test out the hosted sample

- [Try out MockBot](https://microsoft.github.io/BotFramework-WebChat/15.b.incoming-activity-event)

# Things to try out

- Open development console in your browser
- Type "help" in the send box
- In the console log, you will see bunches of incoming activities sent from the bot

# Overview

First, we will set up our store to use middleware that will dispatch an event whenever an incoming activity is received.

```diff
  const store = window.WebChat.createStore(
    {},
    ({ dispatch }) => next => action => {
+      if (action.type === 'DIRECT_LINE/INCOMING_ACTIVITY') {
+        const event = new Event('webchatincomingactivity');

+        event.data = action.payload.activity;
+        window.dispatchEvent(event);
+      }

      return next(action);
    }
  );

```

Next, add an event listener to write to the console whenever `webchatincomingactivity` is detected, like so:

```diff
+ window.addEventListener('webchatincomingactivity', ({ data }) => {
+   console.log(`Received an activity of type "${ data.type }":`);
+   console.log(data);
+ });
```

Make sure our new store is added to the render of Web Chat, and that's it!

```diff
window.WebChat.renderWebChat({
  directLine: window.WebChat.createDirectLine({ token }),
+ store
}, document.getElementById('webchat'));
```

        // We are adding a new middleware to customize the behavior of DIRECT_LINE/INCOMING_ACTIVITY.

            return next(action);
          }
        );

        window.WebChat.renderWebChat({
          directLine: window.WebChat.createDirectLine({ token }),

        document.querySelector('#webchat > *').focus();
